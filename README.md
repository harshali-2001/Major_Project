🌦️ **Introduction:** The research focuses on the use of Machine learning to improve weather forecasting by analyzing radar data and predicting crucial weather elements.

🔍 **Proposed Model:** The research proposes a model that demonstrates the correlation between different radar elements and can accurately predict weather parameters.

🛠️ **Tools and Techniques:** The research utilizes tools such as Python’s Measurements bundle, Numeric Python, Pandas, Django, TensorFlow, Seaborn, Artificial Neural Networks, Repetitive Brain Organization, and Long Transient Memory for data analysis and perception generation.

💻 **System Requirements:** The proposed system includes requirements analysis, hardware requirements, software requirements, and graphical user interface. The software requirements include Python as the language of programming, NumPy, PY-art, Matplotlib, Google Colab as development platform, and Django, HTML, and CSS for frontend.

🖥️ **Graphical User Interface:** The graphical user interface enables the user to view radar data and extract radar information which can be downloaded and further used for prediction purpose.

🚀 **Implementation Process:** The first step of implementation involves collecting the dataset to prepare the neural network. The dataset was collected from the Regional Meteorological Centre of the Nagpur region and converted into radar data values. A web application was designed to make the process of creating datasets from raw files in a batch much simpler.

📊 **Linear Regression Model:** An Excel spreadsheet containing the downloaded radar data is utilized as an input for a linear regression model for determining the correlation between its elements.

🧠 **LSTM Model:** The LSTM model is then trained for the prediction of the two major radar elements.

🌎 **Conclusion:** The research highlights the potential of AI and machine learning in weather forecasting and emphasizes the importance of accurate prediction of weather parameters to avert environmental harm and global calamities.
